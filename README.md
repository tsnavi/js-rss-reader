Created this during my attempts to display a Mastodon feed on my Neocities website. Because Neocities doesn't allow me to use Mastodon's own .rss feeds I had to upload my own, but this should work if you plug in any URL as long as the domain's CSP allows it.

Fundamentally, this is designed to fetch the data from an rss feed and then, using javascript, spit it out into a waiting html element. I've tried to show with comments how you can customise this to your own ends, but if you just want a working 'mastodon.rss to date+toot table' in html, this will should work out of the box.
